## Introduction and problem statement



<img src="img/dalle_prompt.png" width = 300 align="right" style="margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em;"/>A pivotal aspect of empirical social science is the reliable and valid measurement of the concepts of interest. Before we can study the things that we are interested in (e.g., attitudes, emotions, opinions, behavior...), we must define the construct of interest and build instruments that measure it accurately. Scale development and validation is its own large research field and much advances have been made with regard to how we should go about developing and validating instruments and scales. Developing a proper scale is its own research project, often spanning several studies from initial item development through qualitative work, cognitive pretesting and formative evaluation by experts, pilot test, initial empirical studies to refine and reduce the item pool, to a final confirmation of the factorial structure based on a representative sample. 

Yet, the scholarly practice often looks quite different. A lot of the published studies either a) used "existing" scales, whose validity is often unknown, or b) developed adhoc-scales which are often comparatively short and specific to the purpose of the study. On top, these "existing" or adhoc-scales are not much scrutinized with regard to their reliability and validity. A short descriptive analysis of the resulting mean indices and Cronbach's alpha are often the only aspects that are reported. Comprehensive descriptive analyses of individual items, correlations between them, confirmatory factor analyses, as well as psychometric properties such as composite reliability (McDonald's omega), average variance extracted (AVE) and validity analysis (incl. convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity) are mostly missing.

## The goal of this repository

On this page, we aim to collect resources related to scale development and validation (incl. overall guidelines, literature, tutorials, R scripts, etc.) to improve the scholarly practices related to the reporting of measures, the development of instruments and scales, and the knowledge and awareness of challenges, problems and issues. The goal is to organize relevant information and resources in an easy-to-access type of way. 

<br>

## Overview

- [Getting Started](getting-started): A first introduction to scale development and validation consisting of 6 important steps

- [Guidelines](guidelines.html): A list of aspects that are important to take into account and report in a scientific study (independent of whether a scale was developed or not)

- [R Resources](r-resources.html): A collection of links to relevant packages and tutorials that are useful to conduct psychometric analyses, confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses, as well as alternative approaches such as item reponse theory

- [Literature](literature.html): A growing list of relevant articles and books on various topics related to scale development and validation


We hope this repository will help interested scholars to improve their reporting of measures and learn more about the complex task of developing proper scales and measures.
